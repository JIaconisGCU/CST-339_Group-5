For eclipse:
At the top, go to Window>Preferences, then go down General>Security>Secure Storage>Contents. If you have a default secure storage, delete it.
Then go to File>Import, under Git choose Project from Git, Clone URI WITH SMART IMPORT, then copy and paste the repository URL into the URI box.
To authenticate your account, you will need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from GitHub. For mine, I made a classic token with all permissions and no expiration, and named it Eclipse. In Eclipse, put in your username and the code for the token as the password.
  This might have some security concerns, I don't really understand the PAT system. You're of course welcome to investigate a safer and more appropriate way to generate one.
Please do not import the MASTER branch of the repository, only the DEVELOPMENT branch.
Verify that it is importing the project as Maven, then click Finish.
Run Group5Application.java and go to localhost:8080 in a web browser. You should have the Hello World page. If so, you've successfully imported the project!
